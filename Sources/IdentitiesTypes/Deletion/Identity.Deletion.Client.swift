    /// The `Client` struct manages the secure, multi-step process of deleting user identities:
    /// 1. Requesting deletion (requires re-authentication)
    /// 2. Confirming or canceling the deletion request
    ///
    /// > Important: Identity deletion is irreversible once confirmed. The multi-step process
    /// helps prevent accidental deletions.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    /// ```swift
    /// @Dependency(\.identity.delete.client) var client
    ///
    /// // Request identity deletion
    /// try await client.request(reauthToken: "reauth_token")
    ///
    /// // Later, either confirm or cancel
    /// try await client.confirm() // Permanently deletes identity
    /// // or
    /// try await client.cancel()  // Cancels deletion request
    /// ```
