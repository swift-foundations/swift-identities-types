    /// The deletion flow consists of three possible actions:
    /// 1. Initiating deletion (requires re-authentication)
    /// 2. Confirming the deletion
    /// 3. Canceling a pending deletion
    ///
    /// This multi-step process helps prevent accidental identity deletions. Example flow:
    /// ```swift
    /// // 1. Start deletion (requires recent authentication)
    /// let delete = Identity.Deletion.API.request(
    ///   .init(reauthToken: "recent-auth-token")
    /// )
    ///
    /// // 2. Identity can either confirm:
    /// let confirm = Identity.Deletion.API.confirm
    ///
    /// // Or cancel:
    /// let cancel = Identity.Deletion.API.cancel
    /// ```
    ///
    /// > Important: Identity deletion is permanent and cannot be undone after confirmation.
    /// > Identities have a grace period between request and confirmation during which they can cancel.
