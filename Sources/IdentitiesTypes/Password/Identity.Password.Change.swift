extension Identity.Password.Change {
    /// Type alias for reauthorization requirements during password changes.
    ///
    /// While this type alias creates an indirect namespace path
    /// (`Identity.Password.Change.Reauthorization`), this approach offers several benefits:
    ///
    /// - **Domain Context**: The alias clearly indicates this reauthorization is specifically
    ///   for password changes, making the code's intent more explicit
    ///
    /// - **Feature Isolation**: Allows password-change-specific reauthorization behavior or
    ///   extensions to be added without affecting the base `Identity.Reauthorization` type
    ///
    /// - **Discoverability**: Developers working with password changes will naturally find
    ///   reauthorization requirements through code completion within the `Password.Change` namespace
    ///
    /// - **Type Safety**: Provides semantic meaning - even though it's the same underlying type,
    ///   the alias signals this is specifically for password change flows
    ///
    /// - **Future Flexibility**: If password change reauthorization needs to diverge from the
    ///   base implementation, the alias can be replaced with a distinct type without changing
    ///   the public API
    public typealias Reauthorization = Identity.Reauthorization
